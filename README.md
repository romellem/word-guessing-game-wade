# Word Guessing Game

The idea is:

- Enter a category to get a list of _related_ words.
    - These words can be removed or modified by clicking on the card and editing them.
- Once you are happy with your list, select who is **The Guesser**.
- The Guesser leaves the room, and you reveal what the secret word is.
- Everyone else tries to get The Guesser to guess that word based off a series of _clues_.
- Everyone else writes down their single word clue.
- Once everyone has written down their clue, they reveal the clues to the remaining members.
- If anyone wrote a clue that _is the same as someone else's clue_ then **both** clues are removed.
- Once the clues have been pruned, check the box at the bottom to hide the secret word.
- The Guesser comes back in the room, and everyone gives them the unique clues.
- The Guesser then tries to guess what the secret word is!
